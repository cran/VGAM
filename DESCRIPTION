Description: An implementation of about 6 major classes of
    statistical regression models. At the heart of it are the
    vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM)
    classes.  Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated
    by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE, using
    Fisher scoring. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate
    GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs (i.e., with smoothing). The
    other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic
    RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction
    models)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained
    quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well
    as constrained additive ordination (CAO). Note that these
    functions are subject to change, especially before version
    1.0.0 is released; see the NEWS file for latest changes.
