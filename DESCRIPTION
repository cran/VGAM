Description: An implementation of about 6 major classes of
    statistical regression models. At the heart of it are the
    vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM)
    classes. Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented,
    i.e., no random-effects models. Many (150+) models and
    distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation
    (MLE) or penalized MLE, using Fisher scoring. VGLMs can be
    loosely thought of as multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven
    VGLMs (i.e., with smoothing). The other classes are RR-VGLMs
    (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs,
    RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes perform
    constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO)
    models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination
    (CAO). Note that these functions are subject to change,
    especially before version 1.0.0 is released; see the NEWS
    file for latest changes.
