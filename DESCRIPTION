Description: Vector generalized linear and additive models, and
        associated models (Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs,
        Reduced-Rank VGAMs). This package fits many models and
        distribution by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or
        penalized MLE. Also fits constrained ordination models in
        ecology.
