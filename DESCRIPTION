Description: Vector generalized linear and additive models, and
    associated models (Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs,
    Reduced-Rank VGAMs). This package fits many models and
    distribution by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or
    penalized MLE. Also fits constrained ordination models in
    ecology.
