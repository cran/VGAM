Description: This package fits many (150+) models and
    distributions by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
    or penalized MLE, using Fisher scoring. This is done
    via the vector generalized linear and additive model
    (VGLM/VGAM) classes and associated models (reduced-rank
    VGLMs, quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, row-column
    interaction models). These are abbreviated RR-VGLMs,
    QRR-VGLMs, RR-VGAMs and RCIMs. These include constrained
    and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models
    in ecology as well as constrained additive ordination
    (CAO). Note that these functions are subject to change,
    especially before version 1.0.0 is released; see the NEWS
    file for latest changes.
