	* R/links.q (all link functions): big changes, when
	  deriv >= 1 wrt 'inverse' argument. For example,
	  logit(p, deriv = 1, inverse = TRUE) is now
	  logit(p, deriv = 1, inverse = FALSE).
	  Models fitted under <= VGAM 0.9-9 and saved might not work
	  under >= VGAM 1.0-0.

	* R/family.normal.R (tobit): tobit()@weight implements
	  Fisher scoring entirely.
