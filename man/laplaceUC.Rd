\title{ The Laplace Distribution }
\description{
  Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation
  for the Laplace distribution with location parameter \code{location}
  and scale parameter \code{scale}.

}
\usage{
dlaplace(x, location = 0, scale = 1, log = FALSE)
plaplace(q, location = 0, scale = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qlaplace(p, location = 0, scale = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rlaplace(n, location = 0, scale = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x, q}{vector of quantiles.}
  \item{p}{vector of probabilities.}
  \item{n}{number of observations.
  Same as in \code{\link[stats]{runif}}.

  }
  \item{location}{
    the location parameter \eqn{a}, which is the mean.


  }
  \item{scale}{
  the scale parameter \eqn{b}.
  Must consist of positive values.


  }
  \item{log}{
  Logical.
  If \code{log = TRUE} then the logarithm of the density is returned.


  }
  \item{lower.tail, log.p}{
  Same meaning as in \code{\link[stats:Normal]{pnorm}}
  or \code{\link[stats:Normal]{qnorm}}.


  }

\details{
  The Laplace distribution is often known as the double-exponential
  distribution and, for modelling, has heavier tail
  than the normal distribution.
  The Laplace density function is
  \deqn{f(y) = \frac{1}{2b} \exp \left( - \frac{|y-a|}{b}
                    \right) }{%
        f(y) =  (1/(2b)) exp( -|y-a|/b ) }
  where \eqn{-\infty<y<\infty}{-Inf<y<Inf},
  \eqn{-\infty<a<\infty}{-Inf<a<Inf} and
  \eqn{b>0}.
  The mean is \eqn{a}{a} and the variance is \eqn{2b^2}.


  See \code{\link{laplace}}, the \pkg{VGAM} family function
  for estimating the two parameters by maximum likelihood estimation,
  for formulae and details.
  Apart from \code{n}, all the above arguments may be vectors and
  are recyled to the appropriate length if necessary.


}
\value{
  \code{dlaplace} gives the density,
  \code{plaplace} gives the distribution function,
  \code{qlaplace} gives the quantile function, and
  \code{rlaplace} generates random deviates.
