\title{ One-truncated Logarithmic Distribution }
\description{
  Density, distribution function,
  quantile function,
  and random generation
  for the one-truncated logarithmic distribution.



}
\usage{
dotlog(x, shape, log = FALSE)
potlog(q, shape, log.p = FALSE)
qotlog(p, shape)
rotlog(n, shape)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x, q}{
   Vector of quantiles. For the density, it should be a vector with
   integer values \eqn{> 1} in order for the probabilities to be positive.


  }
  \item{p}{vector of probabilities.}
  \item{n}{number of observations.
  Same as in \code{\link[stats]{runif}}.


  }
  \item{shape}{
   The parameter value \eqn{c} described in in \code{\link{logff}}.
   Here it is called \code{shape} because \eqn{0<c<1} is the range.


%   For \code{rotlog()} this pa%arameter must be of length 1.


  }
  \item{log, log.p}{
  Logical.
  If \code{log.p = TRUE} then all probabilities \code{p} are
  given as \code{log(p)}.


  }
}
\details{
  The one-truncated logarithmic distribution is a logarithmic distribution but with
  the probability of a one being zero. The other probabilities are scaled
  to add to unity.
  Some more details are given in \code{\link{logff}}.


}
\value{
  \code{dotlog} gives the density,
  \code{potlog} gives the distribution function,
  \code{qotlog} gives the quantile function, and
  \code{rotlog} generates random deviates.

\note{
  Given some response data, the \pkg{VGAM} family function
  \code{\link{otlog}} estimates the parameter \code{shape}.
  Function \code{potlog()} suffers from the problems that
  \code{\link{plog}} sometimes has.
